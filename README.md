# Simplest-Search
Description
Let's implement the simplest search engine possible ever. It should search for a specific word in a multi-word input line.

The input line contains several words separated by a space. The words are numbered according to their order, with the first word having index 1. Consider that all the words in the line are unique, so there can be no repetition.

Objectives
Write a simple program that reads two lines: a line of words and a line containing the search word. The program must search in the first line for a word specified in the second one. The program should output the index of the specified word. If there is no such word in the first line, the program should print Not Found. Please remember that indexes start from 1!

You should output exactly one line.
